Cerad Core Bundle
===============================

Resisted making a core bundle for as long as possible as they tend to be garbage collectors.

However, the Model/Role/Form listeners needed a home.  So here we are.

And now see what happens if this becomes an actual repository of it's own.

Copied composer.json from packagist, symfony and fos.

Did the packagist thing and the service hook in github.  I think.

Installed it for appgames.  Seemed to go okay though readme was one version out of date.

Try checking from the vendor directory.

git remote -v shows composer and origin.  The origin is not set to https.
git remote rm composer origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/cerad/CeradCoreBundle
